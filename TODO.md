# TODO List for Guard Dashboard Modifications

## Task: Modify Violation & Suspension Check and Layout
- [ ] Move "No Previous Violations" indicator to Vehicle & Owner Info section as a small, always-visible indicator in ExitGuardDashboard.tsx
- [ ] Remove the conditional "Violation and Suspension Status" section from ExitGuardDashboard.tsx
- [ ] Remove "6+ Wheeler" card from vehicle type cards in ExitGuardDashboard.tsx (leave 3 cards)
